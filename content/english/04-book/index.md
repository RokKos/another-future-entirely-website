Short fiction stories are set in different worlds and potential situations of present and future time. They are researching our ways of coexisting from the perspective of humans, as well as animate and inanimate nature. The stories in the book, suitable for older and younger generations, are complemented by a semi-scientific article, which can be a good starting point for a deeper research on the topic.
