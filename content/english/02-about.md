Another Future Entirely presents a multi-layered art and research project created by Nejc Trampuž. Research-oriented work comprises a multimedia installation and a publication of the same name, addressing current environmental issues of the Anthropocene and observing the accelerating changes driven by late capitalism, such as global warming and biodiversity loss. With this project, we wish to present some potential solutions to the pressing environmental issues and optimistic answers to various blemishes created by 21st-century society that promote a purposeful view of our shared future. The goal is to challenge our traditional assumptions and beliefs and strengthen our environmental awareness, thus creating a space for contemplating the immediate future within our primary ecosystem – Planet Earth. 

During his research and all the way to the final realization of his project, Nejc Trampuž used various algorithmic functions available today. The dialogues, presented as a two-channel audio-visual projection, as well as the stories and collages published in the eco fiction anthology book of short stories, were created with the assistance of artificial intelligence.

The project, which was premiered in 2023 at the Simulaker Gallery (Novo mesto, Slovenia), was produced under the patronage of the institute LokalPatriot and KonS ≡ Platform for Contemporary Investigative Arts (Ljubljana, Slovenia).
