AI-based multimedia art and research project Another Future Entirely by artist Nejc Trampuž offers a refreshing approach to environmental awareness by presenting a brighter, sustainable future and social justice. It includes an audiovisual projection of dialogs and an anthology of short fiction stories.

What could a more ecological society actually look like? What should our values be? Should we get rid of capitalism? Is technology really a solution? How can we achieve resilience in the face of climate change? Is all this just a utopia? 

With the assistance of future technology: artificial intelligence (AI), Trampuž created a mental tool that shows us a future, where protection of the ecosystem and social justice is a priority and where we can develop solutions for the global challenges driven by late capitalism and overconsumption, such as global warming and biodiversity loss. The AI learns from the content created by humans and therefore represents a mirror of our discourse and society. At the same time, it allows us to go beyond the familiar and enter the realm of the non-existent. Undeniably, this tool will profoundly affect our society and also our artistic and creative production. Therefore, Trampuž believes that we must explore this new technology and its meaningful applications and also warn of some harmful consequences that this technology might bring. AI was used for writing texts and generating images, which were then collaged together in the final result.
